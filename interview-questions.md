# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: I cannot recall object- oriented programming. I do know however that the coding language utilizes it. It is because the data types in ruby are all separated into different class types. Therefore any function that is made for an object in a class would be called a method. It is utilized so objects are the focus of manipulation instead of just the basic datatypes by themselves. Functional programming is based on the use of functions themselves in their usuability not applied to a specific object. Therefore functional programming is more universal while object oriented programming requires a known value to be utilized.

Researched answer:Object-oriented programming is more focused on the manipulation of objects rather than functions and logic. It is used more for large and complex programs with a large collaborative effort. An issue with that is that an object becomes a mutable or non changing data. Functional programming focuses on the logic in which anything can be passed into it and an outcome is achieved. Functions can be inputed in other functions to create higher order functions allowing for more complex processes to be made.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: The difference between float and an integer resides in the decimal point. Integers are the whole numbers such as 1,2,3. A float is the place after the decimal point is laid out and a number is added to the right of it. For an example, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 would all be float. 

Researched answer: They are both numerical datatypes. The difference is that float contains a decimal point allowing for more realistic calculations while integers cannot. For an example, we could do 5/2, the outcome in integers would be 2 rounding to the closest int. In order for us to get a float answer we would need either 5 and 2 to be 5.0 or 2.0. This would lead to an exact answer of 2.5.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit return is the act of a function to output the last line of a function without needing a return to state as such. It allows for ease of typing out functions for ruby since the last line of a function is usually what is required from it.

Researched answer: Implicit return will output the last line of code prior to the end keyword. Usually a return keyword will be used to signal what to output from the function however sometimes conditions in the function make the return keyword not useful. This is because the return keyword will stop all other processes in the function from occurring once it is read.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby refers to lines of code. It is used to differenciate the different types of code and their uses within the text editor.

Researched answer: A block is similar to a method in Ruby. The difference is that blocks of code don't have a name associated with them. They are can be called with a do-end statement or curly braces. They are a way to write anonymous functions in a method.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a value from a Ruby hash is to call upon the hash. Then add square brackets with the key pair inside with colons. This calls upon the hash and within the hash it calls upon the key. From the key, we can get the referenced value.

Researched answer: A hash has key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. The value is associated with each key by a hash rocket.(=>). In order for us to extract the value from the ruby hash is to call the hash with the key assigned to the value in square brackets.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Is a way for a class to cover another class to utilize the methods and values within.

2. RSpec: A testing framework for Ruby. A behavior driven development tool where it looks at the application behaves instead of what it actually does.

3. CRUD: The four basic types of functionality. C is for create. Used for making new entries. R is for read. Allows us to see the data U is for update. Allows us to fix anything or make changes. D is for delete. This is to remove anything that is deemed unnecessary.

4. Test-driven development: An approach prior to coding to state all the necessary features required for the code to operate. Creating tests for the code to pass in order for criteria to be met.

5. HTTP:Hypertext transfer protocol. Used to transfer information between a client and server or a machine that sends information and one that recieves it.
